# contfd/contfdrt - Files and directory counting

This was a bash script made for a project in an Operating Systems class.

''contfd'' counts, for each provided directory, the number of
sub-directories, executable files, non-executable files and links.
Directories are always specified as relative or absolute to the
user's home dir.

''contfdrt'' does the same but for system directories.
